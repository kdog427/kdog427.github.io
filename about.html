          <p>
            ...to my little slice of the world wide web!
          </p><p>
            Thanks for visiting, I hope you like the look and feel of my website.  It is one of the things I love to do, and it helps me refine my abilities in creating efficient, reusable, and beautiful code.  I am very passionate and detailed-oriented when it comes to getting things done the right way, be it replacing a lightbulb, cooking, or more importantly, developing software.
          </p><p class="pad_the_top">
            This website has a few key features I would like to point out:
            <ul class="feature_list">
              <li>It has been coded from scratch, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the only library I use is jQuery.</li>
              <li>The main page has a number of links spread out in a circle around the central icon. I have spent a lot of time and used a lot of math to ensure I can automatically add another link if I need to in the future, just by adjusting one variable at the top of the script, and the circle will autofill with the new links. This can be seen and interacted with in the My Menu page, which you can try out yourself by clicking right <span class="link"><a href="menu.html">here</a></span>!</li>
              <li>The clock is made by using the same code to map out the numbers, this time the variable I mentioned is just set to 12, and the array of links are null values with just the numbers 1 to 12.</li>
              <li>Every second that ticks by, the page will refresh the clock by wiping away the second, minute, and hour hands and redrawing it at a specific angle as calculated by the Javascript functions I developed.</li>
              <li>I also made sure the site is very responsive no matter what size the window is. It is much easier to interact with on desktop, as shortening the window size will cause the clock to disappear (so it does not cover anything) and elements on the page will shift around.</li>
            </ul>
          </p><p>
            This goes to show, how much I enjoy not only making code, but making code as modular and robust as possible!
          </p><p class="pad_the_top">
            When I am not working on computers, I like to spend my time learning all there is to learn, playing and listening to music, and meditating.
          </p><p>
